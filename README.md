# SwiftUIDragModifier

A description of this package.
This is my first SwiftUI Package. It provides a quick way to make any SwiftUI View draggable.
After installing the Package:

1) Import SwiftUIDragModifier.
2) Create a variable of Type CGSize to pass in to the modifier.
3) Add the makeDragable(with:CGSize) modifier to the view you'd like to make draggable and pass in the variable created in step 2.
4) You can now drag the view anywhere on the canvas!

#Known Bugs #
-Views sometimes jump back to center of the screen(This will be fixed in coming version)
